    "text": "I am originally from San Jose, Costa Rica but I have lived a traveled life. I’ve lived in Costa Rica, Arizona, and Oregon all for a different amount of time. Costa Rica 16 years, Arizona was my home for 4 years, and Oregon for 10 years (and counting).\nThroughout all my years, I’ve always loved watching sports and reading. I will watch just about every sport possible, as boring as some people may consider them to be. My favorite teams, by major sports, are:\n\n\n\nSoccer: Real Madrid\nAmerican Football: Green Bay Packers\n\n\n\nBasketball: Philadelphia 76ers\nBaseball: New York Yankees\n\n\n\nOther than that, I have loved traveling, enjoying different cultures and enjoying every opportunity I come across. I look forward to more to come!"

In this paper, I study a specific pathway through which they do so, by reorienting college graduates towards fields of specialization in demand by Multinational Corporations (MNCs). Using administrative data from a large public university in Costa Rica, I examine whether the local presence of MNCs affects the field of study preference of prospective university students. To capture local exposure to MNC activity, I develop a measure of multinational firm presence by industry and location, incorporating spatial proximity between firms and university applicants. I estimate a multinomial logit model where students choose among broad field of study categories, allowing for hetergeneous effects to MNC presence across industry and academic discipline pairings. Results show that MNCs impact students decisions, with effects varying by industry and field of study. These findings highlight an important and previously understudied channel through which FDI can shape human capital formation in receiving nations."

Forrest Williams\nWage rates, eﬃciency wages, and gift exchange in a labor market are all crucial aspects in regard to designing contracts to ensure high eﬀort from workers. We extend this literature by discussing the relationship between known diﬀerences in wages (social comparison) and workers’ eﬀort provision. We conduct an experiment in which subjects perform eﬀort tasks for piece-rates. All subjects are paid the same wage rate in the first half of the experiment, but in the second half are paid diﬀerent wage rates; the primary variable we study is the information about others’ wage rates given to a subset of subjects. We find that subjects’ eﬀorts respond strongly to information about others’ wages. Such findings have implications for contract structuring for workers."

Costa Rica provides a unique case, as the 2007 CAFTA-DR referendum captured direct public opinion on trade at the canton level. Using canton-level vote share for CAFTA-DR as a proxy for trade support and weighting political party manifesto positions by election results, I construct a canton-level political-lean index. Measuring each canton’s exposure to imports, I find that increased trade exposure shifts political support toward right-leaning parties, though this effect is weaker in cantons with higher initial support for trade. These results highlight that both economic shocks and perceptions of trade influence ideological shifts in developing democracies.\nPaper Draft"

The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics.\nBuilding off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents’ decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Student Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Jose has a way of teaching that is clear and easy to follow. He is a gifted teacher, and am grateful and blessed to have had him.”\n“Jose made accommodations for me when I needed it, and made time outside of class to go over material which I found to be very helpful. Great guy and teacher.”\n“Jose had an interesting way of teaching in which he was relatable and made the content he was teaching easy to learn.

Jose wants everyone to do well and interpret economics theories in a digestible way.”\n“Accommodating and creates an environment where it is easy to ask questions”\n“The in-class activities where we had all simulated being countries with different resources were very fun and engaging to class material.

It was a low-stakes (in that you didn’t have to complete an entire research project) way of exploring what beginning research in the economics field might look like, something I haven’t had the opportunity to do at this point in time and honestly didn’t know much about. It dove-tailed well with the econometrics class I was taking at the same time, giving me an idea of conceptual and practical ways to execute economics research. Very cool!”\n“The fact that we are pushed to actually understand economics rather than memorize it has helped me immensely. I truly appreciate the actual learning that I have achieved this term.”\n“Jose was an excellent instructor. His feedback on assignments was always so good. He has been one of the most organized instructors I have had, with his own website that made everything super easy to find. Always went above and beyond.”\n\nComplete Course Survey"
