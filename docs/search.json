    "text": "Field Paper\nDoes the Global South Import Ideology Shifts? Evidence from Costa Rica and CAFTA-DR [PDF]\nHas increased access to international markets contributed to political ideology shifts in developing economies? Does ones ex-ante opinion on international trade impact their political leaning after international market access has begun? Previous research has shown that regions impacted negatively by trade have shifted toward political extremes but due to nonexistent regional level information on support for trade, there has been little said about how people’s perception of trade may impact outcomes. Using the unique circumstance of Costa Rica, which placed their decision to join the Free Trade Agreement CAFTA-DR on their populace via a democratic referendum in 2007. I use county-level vote share of support for CAFTA-DR as a proxy of direct opinion on trade. I use political party election manifesto data to rank political leans left-to-right interacted with their received vote share at the county-level to create a county-political-lean index. Assuming that an individuals’ political decision is impacted by the most recent comparative difference, I measure a counties exposure to imports for each election cycle. Results align with previous research and show that increased import competition shifts political support toward right-leaning ideologies. Interestingly, this effect diminishes as support for trade increases. This finding gives further evidence of links between adverse economic shocks to ideological shifts while adding the role of economic agent perception of trade and their interpretation of outcomes from it."

    "text": "EC 311 - Intermediate Microeconomics\nThe objective of this course is to provide you with an introduction to, and overview of, the most important concepts in microeconomics. The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics.\nBuilding off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents’ decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense."
