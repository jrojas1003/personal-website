    "text": "I am originally from San Jose, Costa Rica but I have lived a traveled life. I’ve lived in Costa Rica, Arizona, and Oregon all for a different amount of time. Costa Rica 16 years, Arizona was my home for 4 years, and Oregon for 10 years (and counting).\nThroughout all my years, I’ve always loved watching sports and reading. I will watch just about every sport possible, as boring as some people may consider them to be. My favorite teams, by major sports, are:\n\n\n\nSoccer: Real Madrid\nAmerican Football: Green Bay Packers\n\n\n\nBasketball: Philadelphia 76ers\nBaseball: New York Yankees\n\n\n\nOther than that, I have loved traveling, enjoying different cultures and enjoying every opportunity I come across. I look forward to more to come!"

The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics.\nBuilding off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents’ decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Student Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Jose has a way of teaching that is clear and easy to follow. He is a gifted teacher, and am grateful and blessed to have had him.”\n“Jose made accommodations for me when I needed it, and made time outside of class to go over material which I found to be very helpful. Great guy and teacher.”\n“Jose had an interesting way of teaching in which he was relatable and made the content he was teaching easy to learn.

Using administrative data from a large public university in Costa Rica, I examine whether the local presence of MNCs affects the field of study preference of prospective university students. To capture local exposure to MNC activity, I develop a measure of multinational firm presence by industry and location, incorporating spatial proximity between firms and university applicants.

Forrest Williams\nWage rates, eﬃciency wages, and gift exchange in a labor market are all crucial aspects in regard to designing contracts to ensure high eﬀort from workers. We extend this literature by discussing the relationship between known diﬀerences in wages (social comparison) and workers’ eﬀort provision. We conduct an experiment in which subjects perform eﬀort tasks for piece-rates. All subjects are paid the same wage rate in the first half of the experiment, but in the second half are paid diﬀerent wage rates; the primary variable we study is the information about others’ wage rates given to a subset of subjects. We find that subjects’ eﬀorts respond strongly to information about others’ wages. Such findings have implications for contract structuring for workers."

Costa Rica provides a unique case, as the 2007 CAFTA-DR referendum captured direct public opinion on trade at the canton level. Using canton-level vote share for CAFTA-DR as a proxy for trade support and weighting political party manifesto positions by election results, I construct a canton-level political-lean index. Measuring each canton’s exposure to imports, I find that increased trade exposure shifts political support toward right-leaning parties, though this effect is weaker in cantons with higher initial support for trade. These results highlight that both economic shocks and perceptions of trade influence ideological shifts in developing democracies.\nPaper Draft"
