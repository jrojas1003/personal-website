The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics.\nBuilding off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents’ decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSelected Student Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Jose has a way of teaching that is clear and easy to follow. He is a gifted teacher, and am grateful and blessed to have had him.”\n“Jose made accommodations for me when I needed it, and made time outside of class to go over material which I found to be very helpful. Great guy and teacher.”\n“Jose had an interesting way of teaching in which he was relatable and made the content he was teaching easy to learn. The learning experience was the best out of any other teacher i have had at the UO. I would hope he continues teaching!”\n\n\n\n\n\nEC 320: Introduction to Economtetrics\nSummer 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCourse Description\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of classical statistical techniques of estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression to economic models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSelected Student Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC 380: International Economic Issues\nFall 2024, Winter 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCourse Description\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange across international boundaries, theory of comparative advantage, balance of payments and adjustments, international financial movements, exchange rates and international financial institutions, trade restrictions and policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSelected Student Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have gone to Jose’s office hours for homework and midterm review. He is very understanding and thoughtful in his clarification. I appreciate his humor and honestly with the class. Jose wants everyone to do well and interpret economics theories in a digestible way.\nAccommodating and creates an environment where it is easy to ask questions\nThe in-class activities where we had all simulated being countries with different resources were very fun and engaging to class material. Class was very straightforward and engaging at the same time.\nWell structured with concise and organized information. Course had good flow, concepts explained simply but walked through thoroughly. Professor is engaging and includes relevant and recent research or literature in lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC 390: Problems and Issues in the Developing Economies\nFall 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCourse Description\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics may include the role of central planning, capital formation, population growth, agriculture, health and education, interaction between economic and cultural change, and the “North-South debate.”"

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThis paper studies how the local presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) affects students’ college major choices in a developing country context. Using administrative data from Costa Rica’s two largest public universities covering over half a million applicants from 2007 to 2020, I examine whether exposure to MNCs—measured through firm-level location and industry data from the country’s Free Trade Zone (FTZ) regime—shapes individual decisions about field-of-study specialization. I develop a novel index of MNC presence by industry and location, incorporating geographic proximity between applicants and firms. I then estimate a multinomial logit model where students choose among broad and narrow field-of-study categories, allowing for heterogeneous responses to MNC presence across industries. The results show that MNCs meaningfully influence major choice, but the effects vary by industry and field. Service-oriented MNCs, such as those in architectural and engineering services, shift students toward both STEM and arts-related fields, while large manufacturing exporters—like medical device producers—have limited impact on STEM enrollment. Disaggregated analysis reveals that applicants tend to select majors that align with the perceived skill demands of nearby MNCs, suggesting that students respond to local labor market signals when making educational investments. These findings highlight an important and previously understudied channel through which FDI can shape human capital formation—not only through access to education, but also through the type of skills students choose to acquire. The results underscore the need for education and industrial policy coordination to ensure that specialization patterns evolve in step with economic transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\n  Expand"

Using canton-level vote share for CAFTA-DR as a proxy for trade support and weighting political party manifesto positions by election results, I construct a canton-level political-lean index. Measuring each canton’s exposure to imports, I find that increased trade exposure shifts political support toward right-leaning parties, though this effect is weaker in cantons with higher initial support for trade.
