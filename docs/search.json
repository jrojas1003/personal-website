Courses have varied in size from 30 to 90 students while I have also managed teaching assistants.\nIn order to appeal to make the material more accessible and approachable to students, I have created websites for each course with all the necessary content.

The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics.\nBuilding off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agentsâ€™ decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.\n\n\n\n\nEC 320: Introduction to Economtetrics\nSummer 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC 380: International Economic Issues\nFall 2024, Winter 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC 390: Problems and Issues in the Developing Economies\nFall 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description"
