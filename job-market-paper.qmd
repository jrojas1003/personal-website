### Abstract

This paper studies how the local presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) affects students’ college major choices in a developing country context. 
Using administrative data from a large public university in Costa Rica from 2010 to 2019, I examine whether the presence of MNCs - captured through firm industry and location data - affects individuals' field-of-study choice. 
I develop a novel index of MNC presence by industry and location, incorporating geographic proximity between applicants and firms. 
I then estimate a multinomial logit model where students choose among 3 broad field-of-study categories, allowing for heterogeneous responses to MNC presence across industries.
The results show that MNCs meaningfully influence major choice, but the effects vary by industry and field. 
Findings highlight an important and previously understudied channel through which FDI can shape human capital formation — through the human capital concentration students select.
The results underscore the need for education and industrial policy coordination to ensure that specialization patterns evolve in step with economic transformation.
