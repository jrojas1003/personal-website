abstract = {In this chapter we explore the popular but controversial idea that developing countries benefit from abandoning policy neutrality vis-a-vis trade, FDI and resource allocation across industries. Are developing countries justified in imposing tariffs, subsidies, and tax breaks that imply distortions beyond the ones associated with optimal taxes or revenue constraints? We refer to this set of government interventions as “industrial policy.” We explore the theoretical foundation for industrial policy and then review the related empirical literature. We follow this with a broader look at the empirical work on the relationship between trade and FDI and growth. In this review we find no support for “hard” interventions that distort prices to deal with Marshallian externalities, learning by exporting, and knowledge spillovers from FDI. Nevertheless, we still envision an important role for what we refer to as “soft” industrial policy. The goal is to develop a process whereby government, industry and cluster-level private organizations can collaborate on interventions to increase productivity. We suggest programs and grants to help particular clusters by improving the formation of skilled workers, technology adoption, regulation and infrastructure.}

            Governments go to great lengths to attract foreign multinationals because they are thought to raise the wages paid to their employees (direct effects) and to improve outcomes at local domestic firms (indirect effects). We construct the first U.S. employer-employee data set with foreign ownership information from tax records to measure these direct and indirect effects. We find the average direct effect of a foreign multinational firm on its U.S. workers is a 7\% increase in wages. This premium is larger for higher-skilled workers and for the employees of firms from high GDP per capita countries. We find evidence that it is membership in a multinational production network—instead of foreignness—that generates the foreign-firm premium. We leverage the past spatial clustering of foreign-owned firms by country of ownership to identify the indirect effects. An expansion in the foreign-multinational share of commuting-zone employment substantially increases the employment, value added, and—for higher-earning workers—wages at local domestic-owned firms. Per job created by a foreign multinational, our estimates suggest annual gains of US\$13,400 to the aggregate wages of local incumbents, two-thirds of which are from indirect effects. Our estimates suggest that—via mega-deals for subsidies from local governments—foreign multinationals are able to extract a sizable fraction of the local surplus they generate.},

We survey students about what their expected earnings would be both in the major they have chosen and in counterfactual majors. We also elicit students’ subjective assessments of their abilities in chosen and counterfactual majors. We estimate a model of college major choice that incorporates these subjective expectations and assessments. We show that both expected earnings and students’ abilities in the different majors are important determinants of a student’s choice of a college major. We also consider how differences in students’ forecasts about what the average Duke student would earn in different majors versus what they expect they would earn both influence one’s choice of a college major. In particular, our estimates suggest that 7.8\% of students would switch majors if they had the same expectations about the average returns to different majors and differed only in their perceived comparative advantages across these majors.},

We argue that the "routinization" hypothesis recently proposed by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) is a better explanation of job polarization, though other factors may also be important.

	abstract = {Recent empirical analyses reveal substantial gender differences in the choices of and persistence in college majors, most prominently in signiﬁcant underrepresentation of women in STEM and other quantitatively oriented ﬁelds. Such majors also happen to lead to relatively more lucrative careers; they also tend to feature lower grades. Empirical studies offer competing explanations for this gender imbalance. Some suggest that female students tend to generally exhibit stronger aversion to low grades, hence to low-grading disciplines. Competing evidence suggests that these gender biases are driven by differences in preferences toward pecuniary and non-pecuniary aspects of post-college careers. I develop a theoretical model, which proposes a foundation for the latter explanation as a predominant one and reconciles it with the empirical evidence of gender differences in responsiveness to grades. The paper argues that a student’s responsiveness to grades, in choosing and persisting in a major, is ﬁeld-speciﬁc and is the stronger, the weaker the student’s preferential attachment to it. A key implication is that students who attach high importance to pecuniary beneﬁts of post-college careers will be more tolerant toward inferior grades in their decisions to persist in more lucrative majors. It further explains why such students also tend to drop out of college at higher rates rather than switch to a less lucrative major.},

The model features a multi-sector economy with overlapping generations, heterogeneous workers, endogenous accumulation of sector-speciﬁc experience, and costly switching of sectors. The model’s estimates yield median costs of mobility ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 times annual average wages, but a high dispersion of these costs across the population. In addition, sector-speciﬁc experience is imperfectly transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility. Using the estimated model for counterfactual trade liberalization experiments, the main ﬁndings are: (1) there is a large labor market response following trade liberalization but the transition may take several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are signiﬁcantly reduced due to the delayed adjustment; (3) trade-induced welfare effects depend on initial sector of employment and on worker demographics such as age and education. The experiments also highlight the sensitivity of the transitional dynamics with respect to assumptions regarding the mobility of capital.},

The model captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input‐output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We find that the China trade shock resulted in a reduction of about 0.55 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 16\% of the observed decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate, but due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition costs to the new long‐run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.},

	abstract = {Strategy-proofness and assurance of a fair matching are desirable qualities for school choice mechanisms. Although these qualities are theoretical properties of the unrestricted-list deferred acceptance mechanism (DA), it has proven to be hard to go without list-size restrictions in practice. This paper shows how a simple modiﬁcation to the restricted-list DA, in which students are provided more information about vacancies and oﬀered higher-value options in the event of rejection, can mitigate uncertainty and yield matches very close to what would be obtained under the unrestricted-list DA. I estimate an application-portfolio choice model using administrative data from Tunisia, where a sequential implementation of the DA is used to assign high-school graduates to universities. This sequential implementation creates quasi-experimental variation that allows to separate the identiﬁcation of students’ preferences for programs from their expectations about their admission probabilities. Counterfactual simulations show that the average student’s expected ex post utility is signiﬁcantly lower when assignments are made using the standard restricted-list DA than what it would be in the unrestricted-list DA match. Using a sequential implementation, as is done in Tunisia, instead of the standard restricted-list DA, can reduce this welfare loss by 90\%.},

In addition to fixed adjustment costs, workers build up specific human capital over time that is destroyed when they must change occupations. I show that ignoring human capital biases estimates of adjustment costs upward by a factor of 3. Estimating an occupational choice model of the Danish labor market, I show that 57 percent of the dispersion in worker outcomes is accounted for by occupations, and only 16 percent by sectors. Finally, the model suggests that rising import competition from 1995–2005 reduced lifetime earnings for 5 percent of workers. (JEL F14, F16, J24, J31)},

We identify some limitations of this potential, however, to do with the stock of human capital, the interest in local firms of promoting skills transfer and the competition environment. We suggest comparing conditions and effects between regions, particularly between East Asia and Latin America, where transfer in the former has been more consistent than in the latter. We propose further that an analysis of the type of FDI flowing to different regions and countries could provide clues to the potential for maximizing the gains to local skills accumulation. Finally, studies are needed which examine the nature of skills provided by FDI, and ways in which training institutions – business schools, for example – can complement in-service training by firms in FDI host countries.},

The empirical evidence is structured based on the recognition that the drivers of capital flows vary over time and across different types of capital flows. The drivers are classified using the traditional distinction between ‘push’ and ‘pull’ drivers, which continues to serve as a useful framework. Push factors like global risk aversion and external interest rates are found to matter most for portfolio debt and equity flows, but somewhat less for banking flows. Pull factors such as domestic output growth, asset returns and country risk matter for all three capital flows components, but most for banking flows.},

The evidence reviewed in this article is consistent with the view that jobs created by foreign direct investment (FDI) are good jobs, both from the worker's and the country's perspective. From the worker's perspective, this is because such jobs are likely to pay higher wages than jobs in domestic firms, at least in developing countries, and because foreign employers tend to offer more training than local firms do. From the country's perspective, jobs in foreign affiliates are good jobs because FDI inflows boost the aggregate productivity of the host country.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the impact of FDI inflows on higher education in developing countries for the period 1998-2008. A large panel of developing countries is analyzed using different econometric techniques and specifications. We find evidence of short-term negative effect of the FDI on tertiary education measured by school enrolment. The negative effect of FDI is confirmed for both secondary and tertiary education when measured as the adult population having acquired the level. Among other control variables, GDP, demographic growth and the services sector value added seem to have a significant impact on higher education. GDP and services value-added show the expected positive impact, while population growth appears to affect education enrollment and attainment negatively. The study highlights the need for considering the differential aspects of foreign investments’ nature and characteristics, rather than treating them as a cure-all pill for the developing countries’ development problem.},

Our results support the importance of education quality and suggest that with improved quality of education, it does not take as much quantity of schooling, as established in Borensztein et al.

Yet there is little evidence as to whether all degrees improve labor market outcomes, and whether they do so for students from different types of backgrounds. We combine administrative and archival data from Chile with score-based admissions rules at more than 1,100 degree programs to study how the long-run earnings effects of college admission depend on selectivity, field of study, and student characteristics. Our data link admissions outcomes for 30 cohorts of college applicants to administrative records of labor market outcomes up to 30 years post-application. We estimate regression discontinuity specifications for each degree, and describe how threshold-crossing effects vary by degree type. In addition, we use variation in admissions outcomes driven by threshold-crossing to estimate a simple model that maps our discontinuity estimates into causal effects of admission by degree. Observed choice and survey data indicate that the assumptions underlying this model are consistent with student behavior. We find that returns are heterogeneous, with large, positive returns to highly selective degrees and degrees in health, science, and social science fields. Returns to selectivity do not vary by student socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest a role for policies that guide students toward higher-return degrees, such as targeted loans and better college preparation for students from low-income backgrounds.},

A key feature of our model is that education acts simultaneously as a signaling device and as a method for workers to enhance their productivity. We show that when firms can only imperfectly screen workers, the result is an economy in which too many workers purchase schooling and too few workers devote sufficient effort to their coursework to qualify for the high skill labor pool. We then examine how greater openness to international markets alters the skill mix of the domestic workforce and show that greater openness usually eases one labor market distortion while making the other distortion worse. Globalization impacts educational behavior and labor market outcomes differently as the extent of firms engaged in international markets varies, and affects wage inequality both within and across educational groups.},

Treatment causes low-income students to reduce their demand for low-return degrees by 4.6\%, and increases the likelihood they remain in college for at least four years. To understand the mechanisms driving the effect of disclosure policies we estimate a model of college demand.

Consistent with an environment in which students weigh increases in future earnings potential from further education against current labor market opportunities foregone, we ﬁnd that growth in Chinese imports led to declines in wages for all educational groups, and reductions in employment for individuals without a high school degree both in absolute terms and relative to their more educated peers.},

            This article examines the labor market payoffs to different types of postsecondary education, including field and institution of study. Instrumental variables (IV) estimation of the payoff to choosing one type of education compared to another is made particularly challenging by individuals choosing between several types of education. Not only does identification require one instrument per alternative, but it is also necessary to deal with the issue that individuals who choose the same education may have different next-best alternatives. We address these difficulties using rich administrative data for Norway’s postsecondary education system. A centralized admission process creates credible instruments from discontinuities that effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different institutions and fields of study. The admission process also provides information on preferred and next-best alternatives from strategy-proof measures of individuals’ ranking of institutions and fields. The results from our IV approach may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, different fields of study have substantially different labor market payoffs, even after accounting for institution and peer quality. Second, the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study. Third, the estimated payoffs to field of study are consistent with individuals choosing fields in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparing our estimates to those obtained from other approaches highlights the importance of using instruments to correct for selection bias and information on individuals’ ranking of institutions and fields to measure their preferred and next-best alternatives.},

	abstract = {East Asia has experienced fast economic growth along with large inﬂows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and accumulated human capital since the 1960s. Economic literature suggests a link between FDI and human capital development via technology transfer. This study employs a panel of sample data from 16 East Asian countries from 1985 to 2010 to examine the effect of inward FDI on human capital accumulation. The results show that an increase in foreign presence is associated with an increase in secondary schooling, yet has a negative impact on tertiary schooling. FDI from OECD countries presents positive effects on both secondary and tertiary schooling in East Asian countries. The ﬁndings are robust to different measures of educational attainment and different speciﬁcations.},

According to statistics of 2015-16, published by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), about 24.5\% of the population is enrolled in the institutes of higher education in the country. Education ministry came up with the proposal of 100\% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in higher education in the country. In the present research we found the relationship between FDI in Education and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education in India. We used econometric techniques to find out the impact of FDI in Education on GER In higher education and also to find out the causal relationship. Both Variables are stationery at first difference i.e. I (I) as per ADF Test. The co-integration test result showed the existence of long-run relationship between Foreign Direct Investments in Education and Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education. The result shows the long-run GER in Higher Education. Granger Causality test indicates a bi-directional relationship between FDI in education and Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education because the probability value is less than 0.10 in both the null hypothesis tested.},

We ﬁnd that taking courses in college that are relevant to one’s occupation is signiﬁcantly associated with higher wages, which can be taken as evidence against the notion that returns to college are principally a matter of signaling. A student’s wage increases, on average, by 1.5–2.1\% for each matched course.},

            This article studies how exclusive social groups shape upward mobility and whether interactions between low- and high-status peers can integrate the top rungs of the economic and social ladders. Our setting is Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where new groups of students arriving on campus encountered a social system centered on exclusive old boys’ clubs. Combining archival and census records, we first show that students from prestigious private feeder schools are overrepresented in old boys’ clubs, while academic high achievers and ethnic minorities are almost completely absent. Club members earn \$32{\textbackslash}\%\$ more than other students and are more likely to work in finance and join country clubs, both characteristic of the era’s elite. We use random variation in room assignment to show that exposure to high-status peers expands gaps in college club membership, adult social club membership, and finance careers by high school type, with large positive effects for private school students and zero or negative effects for others. To conclude, we turn to more recent cohorts. We show that the link between exclusive college clubs and finance careers persists across the twentieth century even as Harvard diversifies, and that elite university students from the highest-income families continue to outearn their peers.},

Consistent with theory, students with an outside option are more likely to list popular, highly-rated schools under the Boston mechanism, and this gap disappears after switching to a Deferred Acceptance mechanism.},

Access to the economics major shifts students' preferences toward business/finance careers, and about half of the wage return is explained by economics majors working in higher-paying industries.

However, different educational levels do not have the same level of significance; tertiary education appears to have the greatest influence. As far as gender is concerned, the level of female participation in the workforce seems to be crucial in attracting FDI, and governments should therefore adopt policies to promote women’s empowerment.},
