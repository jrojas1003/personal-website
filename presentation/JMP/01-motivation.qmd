Growth since 2000 not levels (graph error)

Tertiary education is useless by itself, it requires a labor market to complement it

## Research Question {#research-question}

[Hypothesis: Multinational Firms affect skill specialization decisions]{.hp .align-center .big}

::: {.small}
- I use administrative data of university applications and location of MNCs within industrial parks in Costa Rica from 2010 to 2019

[Identification Strategy]{.hp .align-center .big}

- Spatial and temporal variation in industry composition
- Distance between students and MNCs
- [Key Variable:]{.h} Exposure to near MNCs 

::: {.notes}
Students are aware of all multinational firms in the country, but they receive stronger "signals" from nearby oness

## Preview of Results 

- A shift from low to high exposure to [Manufacturing MNCs]{.hp} increases the probability of choosing a major within [Stem and Applied Sciences by 52.9 p.p.]{.hp} 
    - [Decreases probability of choosing Arts by 25 p.p. and Social Sciences by 27.9 p.p.]{.h}

::: {.small}
::: {.faded}
- A shift from low to high exposure to [Administrative Service MNCs]{.hp} increases the probability of choosing a major within [Social Sciences and Professional Studies by 39.81 p.p.]{.hp}
    - [Decreases the probability of choosing Arts by 30.58 p.p. and STEM and Applied Sciences by 8.96 p.p.]{.h}

- Directional effects are robust to removing the industry-field mapping
- Multinational Firm effects are extremely local
- Heterogeneity tests show no difference between men and women

distance decay: Strong within 5km but decays rapidly. Students respond to hyper-local labor-market signals.
