## Conclusion

::: {.vertical-center}
- Multinationals reshape local incentives to acquire skills
- I ask if this influence impacts students choice of major through being exposed to multinationals
- Using local exposure to multinational firms, I estimate how exposure to MNC activity shapes field of study application decisions
- Results suggest that students choice of field of study are shifted to those that better align with MNC industry needs
- This highlights a new channel through which FDI shapes formation of human capital in LMICs
