## Teaching Experience

I have accumulated extensive teaching experience during my time as a PhD Student. 
The courses I have taught range from foundational economic theory courses, elective courses, and econometric courses; all at the undergraduate level. 
I have taught them in 4 week and 10 week modules, as well as in-person and online. 
Courses have varied in size from 30 to 90 students while I have also managed teaching assistants. 

In order to appeal to make the material more accessible and approachable to students, I have created websites for each course with all the necessary content.
You can find links to these at each course below.

### Course Description

The objective of this course is to provide you with an introduction to, and overview of, the most important concepts in microeconomics.
The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics. 

Building off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents' decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. 
Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.
