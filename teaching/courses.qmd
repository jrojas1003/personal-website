## EC 311 - Intermediate Microeconomics

The objective of this course is to provide you with an introduction to, and overview of, the most important concepts in microeconomics.
The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including international trade, labor, development, and other fields, and is essential for further study in economics. 

Building off of basic microeconomic concepts, students will develop the ability to examine models of agents' decisions, including consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, and market equilibria. 
Most importantly, students will develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in both the economic and critical thinking sense.
